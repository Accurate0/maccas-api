- batch and event need apis to allow visibility and control over jobs
    - manual triggers etc
- frontend to show this through /admin
- use access token auth etc etc
- nginx or some sort of api gateway to allow each to sit behind a single api.domain/event api.domain/batch
- add versioning to events / jobs
